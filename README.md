# Cherry Desktop Template
Welcome to the Cherry Desktop Template!  
This is a really simple example of a small app created with the [Cherry UI/UX library](https://github.com/infiniteHQ/Cherry).

Some more advanced examples will be created in the future.

---

This example is based on our ["Create your first app" section](https://cherry.infinite.si/docpage?content_name=introduction&page_name=create_first_app&version=1.3&section=all) of the Cherry documentation, but we added more features and things that might interest you.  
Every change includes comments to help you understand.
